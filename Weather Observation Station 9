Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
table: STATION(ID number ,city varchar2(21),state varchar2(2),LAT_N number, LONG_W number)

WHAT WE WANT: - non duplicate values of city - the 1st charater of city should NOT be a,e,i,o,u 
HINT: NOT LIKE can be used ,NOT IN 


SOLUTION: 
select DISTINCT city from station where city NOT LIKE 'a%' AND city NOT LIKE 'a%' AND city NOT LIKE 'i%' AND city NOT LIKE 'e%' AND city NOT LIKE 'u%'

ALTERNATE SOLUTION:
select DISTINCT city from station where left(city,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u')
