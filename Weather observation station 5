Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:
Field 	Type 
ID	Number
City	VARCHAR(21)
State	VARCHAR(2)
LAT_	NUMBER
LONG_W	Number

what we want : 
-shortest city name 
-longest city name 
- length of the respective cities 
-condition: if there are more than one with same length than sorted alphabetically

Solution:
SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC LIMIT 1 
SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC LIMIT 1


HINT: 
-we use two diffrent queries 
- LENGTH() function is used in MySQL to get length of a string -LEN() is similar in diffrent softwares
