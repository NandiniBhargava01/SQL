Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
TABLE: STATION(ID number ,city varchar2(21),state varchar2(2),LAT_N number, LONG_W number)

WHAT WE WANT: -NON DUPLICATE values of city -the first & last character SHOULD BE either a,e,i,o,u
HINT: use RIGHT() ,LEFT(), SUBSTRING()

SOLUTION:
select DISTINCT city from station where RIGHT(city,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u') AND LEFT(CITY,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u')
