Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

TABLE:  TRIANGLES( A integer,B integer,C integer)

HINT: CASE WHEN ... THEN .... END

SOLUTION:
select CASE 
when (A+B<=c) or (B+c<=A) or (C+A<=B) then 'Not A Triangle'
when A=B AND B=C THEN 'Equilateral'
when A=B OR B=C OR C=A the 'Isosceles'
when A<>B AND B<>C then'Scalene'
END type_of_triangle
