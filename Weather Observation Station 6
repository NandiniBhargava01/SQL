Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
table: STATION(ID number ,city varchar2(21),state varchar2(2),LAT_N number, LONG_W number)

what we want: - non duplicate city names -the first charater of city should be either a,e,i,o,u
HINT: -problem is to find patterns we use wildcards (%,_) while using LIKE - pair OR/AND with LIKE




Solution :
select DISTINCT city from station where city like 'a%' or city like 'e%' or city like 'i%' or city like 'o%' or city like 'u%'; 

alternate answer: 
select city from station where left(city,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u')
