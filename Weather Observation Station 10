Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
TABLE: STATION(ID number ,city varchar2(21),state varchar2(2),LAT_N number, LONG_W number )

WHAT WE WANT:- non duplicate values of city - the end character of city should NOT be a,e,i,o,u


SOLUTION:
select DISTINCT city from station where city not like '%a' AND city not like '%e' AND city not like '%i' AND city not like '%o' AND city not like '%u';   

ALTERNATE SOLUTION:
select DISTINCT city from station where RIGHT(city,1) not in ('a','e','i','o','u')
